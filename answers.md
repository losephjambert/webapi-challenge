- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

1. The Router object

    - The `Router` object is an isolated instance of express middleware and routes. You can use the `Router` object to compose isolated, mini-instances of Express into a larger application.

2. The Application object

    - The `Application` object is the top level function exported from Express. It carries along with it all of Express's built-in middleware, as well as routing capabilities.
